## Summary
### Number of roles needing to be filled
There are 90398 employees who are expected to retire in the near future. There are currently 240124 employees. This means 37.6% of current employees are likely to retire in the near future.

### Are there enough mentors?
Given that there are 90398 employees expected to retire and 1549 employees who are eligible for mentorship, this means there are at least 58 new employees per potential mentor. This is only if all potential mentors wish to actually become mentors to new employees. If, for example, only half wished to, then there would be 116 new employees per mentor. Given that mentorship is only supposed to be part-time, this means that there are likely to be far too few mentors available for the new employees.
